# LuffyDB - A Database No one asked for.

> Experimental Database Written with Bun.sh (JavaScript)

## FAQ
### Why the name Luffy?
Because this database is currently an idiot.
### How to use it?
Just check `example.ts` and to install, just download the executable from Releases and run `install.sh`. I'm too lazy to write a whole frickin documentation.
### Is it better than MySQL/MongoDB?
No, Luffy is dumber and more useless than them. It does not even have a full-fledge backup/restore system.
